# Repetition code for up to 15 qubits

James R. Wootton, University of Basel

This is the source code and data for implementations of the quantum repetition code of up to 15 qubits. For more information, check out [this Jupyter notebook](Repetition_Code.ipynb). This can be used to get your own data from IBM's ibmqx3 device (a 16 qubit processor) or a simulator. It also processes previously saved data. A full set of data for both ibmqx3 and a simulator are provided in the repository. The data displayed in the current version of the Jupyter notebook is for ibmqx3.
